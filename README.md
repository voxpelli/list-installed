# Installed Check Core

Checks that the installed modules fulfill the requirements of `package.json`, both when it comes to the version ranges of the modules themselves and when it comes to the version range of their engine requirements.

Exists as a CLI as well: [installed-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/installed-check)

## Usage

### Simple

```bash
yarn add installed-check-core
```

```javascript
const installedCheck = require('installed-check-core');

installedCheck({ versionCheck: true }).then(result => {
  if (result.errors.length) {
    console.error('Dependency errors: \n\n' + result.errors.join('\n') + '\n');
  }
});
```

## Syntax

```javascript
const { errors, warnings, notices } = await installedCheck({
  path: 'path/to/module',
  engineCheck: true,
  engineIgnores: ['foo'],
  engineNoDev: true,
  versionCheck: true,
});
```

### Parameters

1. `options` – optional object containing additional options for the module

### Returns

A Promise resolving to:

```javascript
{
  notices: ['123'],
  warnings: ['Abc'],
  errors: ['Xyz']
};
```

## Options

* `path` – defaults to `.`. Specifies the path to where the target to be checked can be found, with its `package.json` being there and its `n ode_modules` as well.
* `engineCheck` – if set `installed-check` will check that the installed modules comply with the [engines requirements](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) of the `package.json` and suggest an alternative requirement if the installed modules don't comply.
* `engineIgnores` – if set then the specified module names won't be included in the engine check. `engineIgnores` should an array of module names while the CLI flags should be set once for each module name.
* `engineNoDev` – if set then dev dependencies won't be included in the engine check.
